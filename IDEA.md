## Problem Statements:

**1.** Today is Ritu's birthday. Her father wants to give her a special box of chocolates as chocolate is her favorite. But to make it more interesting 
her father also bought several similar boxes filled with different pastries. Ritu doesn't like pastries, so she asked her mother to identify the correct
box at the first attempt, so she could skip eating pastries. As an advice, Ritu learned a process to identify the special box.Ritu has to arrange all the 
boxes in an increasing manner according to their weights. The box placed in the middle will be the special box. But Ritu's father knowing the fact she will 
get help from her mother has put a rule that she can't touch any box until she chooses one.He made two piles of boxes A and B. A consists n number of boxes 
and B consists m number of boxes. The boxes in each pile are placed one upon another according to their decreasing weights.
Can you help Ritu find her special box filled with chocolates?

**NB:** (n+m) will always be odd.

**Input :**
You will be given the weights present in both piles A and B.

**Output :**
Output the weight of the box containing chocolates.

**2.** Karan along with his friends is developing an application where a user can upload their cooking recipes. Now Karan wants that if user A likes
another user B’s dishes then A can follow B’s account to know all his unique dishes and styles. But the restriction is that B won’t be able to see A’s 
dishes until he follows back A’s account. You have to design an data for the app keeping in mind all the specification.

**Input :**
N - number of users
M - number of connections
A B - A follows B

**Output :**
If Karan wants to know how many followers B has you have to output the number and name of the users.

**3.** Kriti is a food lover and blogger. She loves to visit new food centers and blog about her experiences. She is also famous for her blogging in the city of 
Jamshedpur. One day she decided to visit all the cafeterias of the city and quote her experiences in the newspaper “Hindustan Times”. You are her guide for this 
journey. In order to visit all the cafeterias, you want to know the shortest distance of all from your home. Also to save time for your guest you want to visit the 
cafeteria closet from your home at first and then plan for the next.
