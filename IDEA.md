# DSA Magic

Welcome to the official repository of DSA Magic, which is one of the projects participating in the Winter of Code 2020.
You may make a pull request for atleast 2 of the below given Problem Statement.


## Problem Statements:

**1.** Today is Ritu's birthday. Her father wants to give her a special box of chocolates as chocolate is her favorite. But to make it more interesting 
her father also bought several similar boxes filled with different pastries. Ritu doesn't like pastries, so she asked her mother to identify the correct
box at the first attempt, so she could skip eating pastries. As an advice, Ritu learned a process to identify the special box.Ritu has to arrange all the 
boxes in an increasing manner according to their weights. The box placed in the middle will be the special box. But Ritu's father knowing the fact she will 
get help from her mother has put a rule that she can't touch any box until she chooses one.He made two piles of boxes A and B. A consists n number of boxes 
and B consists m number of boxes. The boxes in each pile are placed one upon another according to their decreasing weights.
Can you help Ritu find her special box filled with chocolates?

**NB:** (n+m) will always be odd.

**Input :**
You will be given the weights present in both piles A and B.

**Output :**
Output the weight of the box containing chocolates.

**2.** Karan along with his friends is developing an application where a user can upload their cooking recipes. Now Karan wants that if user A likes
another user B’s dishes then A can follow B’s account to know all his unique dishes and styles. But the restriction is that B won’t be able to see A’s 
dishes until he follows back A’s account. You have to design an data for the app keeping in mind all the specification.

**Input :**
N - number of users
M - number of connections
A B - A follows B

**Output :**
If Karan wants to know how many followers B has you have to output the number and name of the users.

**3.** Kriti is a food lover and blogger. She loves to visit new food centers and blog about her experiences. She is also famous for her blogging in the city of 
Jamshedpur. One day she decided to visit all the cafeterias of the city and quote her experiences in the newspaper “Hindustan Times”. You are her guide for this 
journey. In order to visit all the cafeterias, you want to know the shortest distance of all from your home. Also to save time for your guest you want to visit the 
cafeteria closet from your home at first and then plan for the next.

**Input :**

**Output :**

## Points to be noted while writing a Proposal.
1. The intution of the code which you are going to implement. If you feel there is a use of any specific Data structure and Algorithm or both do mention them 
   so as to have a positive impact over other's proposal.
2. Clearly mention the time complexity and space complexity of the code which you are going to implement.
3. You have to write proposals for atleast two problems.

## Getting Started

1. First up you need to fork (make a copy) this repo to your Github account.
2. Clone (download) your fork to your computer.
3. Set your streams so you can sync your clone with the original repo (get the latest updates).

   - `git remote add upstream git@github.com:dscnsec/DSC-NSEC-Algorithms.git`
   OR `git remote add upstream https://github.com/dscnsec/DSC-NSEC-Algorithms.git`
   - `git pull upstream master`
   - The above 2 commands will synchronize your forked version of the project with the actual repository.

4. Find a task [here](https://github.com/dscnsec/DSC-NSEC-Algorithms/issues) or [create a task](https://github.com/dscnsec/DSC-NSEC-Algorithms/issues)
   - Comment on the task to claim it, ensuring no-body has done so already.
   - If you created a new task or issue, ensure you specify if you are undertaking the task or if someone else is able to claim it.
   - Keep the issue updated with your progress, inactive issues will be reassigned.
5. Create a branch for your task and complete the task.
6. Pull from the upstream again, like we did in step 3. This is to ensure we still have the latest code.
   - `git pull upstream master`
7. Commit and push the code to your fork.
8. Create a pull request to have the changes merged into the origin.
   - Ensure the title of your PR be in this format: [LANGUAGE] FileName.extension, where filename convention is as per convention.
   - Ensure you add to the comments of the pull request `fixes #<issue number>`, replacing **<issue number>** with the number of your issue will automatically close the issue when the pull request is merged.

## Prerequisites

It is very important to understand the time and space complexity of the algorithms that we devise in order to write an efficient code. Please go through
[this](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/understanding-time-complexity-simple-examples/) and [this](https://github.com/KevinOfNeu/ebooks/blob/master/Grokking%20Algorithms.pdf) to get a clearer picture of the two.
