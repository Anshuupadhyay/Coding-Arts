# Points to be noted while writing a proposal
1. Mention the intution of the code which you are going to implement. If you feel there is a use of any specific Data structure and Algorithm or both, do mention them 
   so as to have a positive impact over other's proposal.
2. Clearly mention the time complexity and space complexity of the code which you are going to implement.
3. You have to write proposals for atleast two problems.

## Getting Started

1. First up you need to fork (make a copy) this repo to your Github account.
2. Clone (download) your fork to your computer.
3. Set your streams so you can sync your clone with the original repo (get the latest updates).

   - `git remote add upstream git@github.com:dscnsec/DSC-NSEC-Algorithms.git`
   OR `git remote add upstream https://github.com/dscnsec/DSC-NSEC-Algorithms.git`
   - `git pull upstream master`
   - The above 2 commands will synchronize your forked version of the project with the actual repository.

4. Find a task [here](https://github.com/dscnsec/DSC-NSEC-Algorithms/issues) or [create a task](https://github.com/dscnsec/DSC-NSEC-Algorithms/issues)
   - Comment on the task to claim it, ensuring no-body has done so already.
   - If you created a new task or issue, ensure you specify if you are undertaking the task or if someone else is able to claim it.
   - Keep the issue updated with your progress, inactive issues will be reassigned.
5. Create a branch for your task and complete the task.
6. Pull from the upstream again, like we did in step 3. This is to ensure we still have the latest code.
   - `git pull upstream master`
7. Commit and push the code to your fork.
8. Create a pull request to have the changes merged into the origin.
   - Ensure the title of your PR be in this format: [LANGUAGE] FileName.extension, where filename convention is as per convention.
   - Ensure you add to the comments of the pull request `fixes #<issue number>`, replacing **<issue number>** with the number of your issue will automatically close the issue when the pull request is merged.

## Prerequisites

It is very important to understand the time and space complexity of the algorithms that we devise in order to write an efficient code. Please go through these examples
[understanding time complexity](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/understanding-time-complexity-simple-examples/) and [Grokking Algorithm](https://github.com/KevinOfNeu/ebooks/blob/master/Grokking%20Algorithms.pdf) to get a clearer picture of the two.
