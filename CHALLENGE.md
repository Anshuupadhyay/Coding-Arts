# Procedure throughout the month
1. Once your proposal is accepted, you will be assigned to a group of three other candidates and you all have to collaboratively work on all the given problem statements.
2. All the groups will be given a time limit of ten days for solving all the problems and making pull requests for the same.
3. Then you all will be provided with the new set of three questions (the difficulty level will be similar). 

 In this way, you will be provided with two new sets of questions every ten days which will help you to engage yourself throughout the month.
